DESCRIPTION = $" 'Light with the intensity: ' .. (2 * $LightsIntensity) "
COLOR = $" { $LightsIntensity * 0.2, $LightsIntensity * 0.3, $LightsIntensity * 0.4 } " ; tables will turn into lists
DIRECTION = $" ${LightsDirection:vec3}:normalize() " ; “:vec3” is not required, but it’ll make sure expression will work even if LightsDirection doesn’t have any numbers in it
