; Notice how indices are starting with 1. Older versions were using 0,
; but now we got Lua onboard and it uses 1. Also, it’s just nicer this way.
; Usually I wouldn’t do something so breaking, but it seems like there is not
; a lot of INIpp stuff yet and this is really annoying to have that difference.
